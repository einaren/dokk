## Why Markdown and GitHub for documentation?

Most people I know rely on tools like PowerPoint, email, and Word for documentation and communication. However, I find Markdown and GitHub a more efficient and collaborative way to manage information. Markdown is simple and uses plain text syntax. This helps your keeping focus on content rather than formatting. Markdown ensures consistent formatting across documents and platforms, enhancing professionalism and making it easier for team members to follow along.

With GitHub, you gain powerful version control. You can track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed, maintaining your documentation over time. Markdown integrates seamlessly with many tools and platforms, including GitHub Pages for hosting documentation, streamlining your workflow and improving team collaboration.
